<p>
In this assignment you will get started with programming in the Go language. To solve this assignment you will need to install Go, figure out how to compile, run, and debug a Go program. You will practice Go in the context of the two-person normal play version of the game of Nim. Specifically, you will implement the client codebase and we will provide you with a running server that you can test against. 
</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
  Go (or <code>golang</code>, as it helps to search for it) is an
  imperative programming language generally aimed at the development
  of distributed systems. In some ways, it is related to systems
  languages like C and Rust, in that programs are built using structs
  and functions (and like Rust, while it supports "methods", they are
  basically just special functions). In other ways it is more similar
  to managed languages like C# and Java, in that, while it does not
  have a VM, it has a lot of "managed" features: it has a garbage
  collector, full runtime type information, and the design strives to
  have essentially no undefined behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  This assignment's objective in particular is to help you get to grips with Go's basic features. You will learn:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to use basic data structures like <a href="https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro">slices</a></li>
  <li>How to work with simple <a href="https://gobyexample.com/structs">struct</a> definitions and methods</li>
  <li>How to work with Go's built-in <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">testing infrastructure</a> (recommended)</li>
  <li>The basics of network programming in Go with UDP</li>
</ul>

<p>
This assignment will also introduce you to
our <a href="https://github.com/DistributedClocks/tracing">tracing
library</a>. You'll use this library throughout the course to test and
debug your Go systems, And, we will use this library to help us mark
your submitted solutions.
</p>


<h4>Nim overview</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Nim is a two-player game. A game of nim starts with a board that
contains some number of <b>rows</b>, and each row contains some number of
<b>coins</b>. The two players take turns removing any non-zero number
of coins, with the constraint that all the coins that are removed in a
turn must come from a single row. A player's goal in nim is to make
the last move, taking the final coin.
</p>


<h4>High-level system description</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
There are two kinds of nodes in the system: a server (that we will
implement), and a client (that you will implement), which will play a
game of Nim against each other. You will test and debug your solution
against a running server instance, but you will not have access to the
server code.
</p>

<p>The server listens to connections from clients and expects UDP
packets containing a serialized <b>[StateMoveMessage]</b>. This is a Go
struct and the only message format used in this assignment. There are
multiple special values that represent different things, but you only
have to worry about one format they are packaged in. This is described
further below.
</p>

<p>
The client reads the [config/client_config.json] JSON file.
This file specifies the UDP IP:port of the server (other player)
that it is to connect to. The client receives a randomization
seed on the command line (the only command line input).
Then, the client follows the following steps:
</p>


<p>
<ol>

<li>The client sends an initial [StateMoveMessage] via UDP to the server with the random seed it received on the command line.
</li>

<li>The client receives a [StateMoveMessage] reply from the server that contains a slice of bytes GameState, representing the opening state of the board.
</li>

<li>The client decides on a move to play, computes the new resulting GameState and sends both back to the server in another [StateMoveMessage].</li>

<li>The server verifies the client's move is <i>legal on receive</i>
and continues play, if applicable. If the received move is <i>not
legal on receive</i>, the server will re-send its previous message.
</li>

<li>The client and server repeat from step 3 until there are no more coins in any row in the last GameState transmitted.</li>

</ol>
</p>


<p>
The diagram below is a time-space diagram that illustrates the
client-server interactions described above. Messages are arrows
between the two timelines, from client to server, or from server to
client. Message content is listed between the brackets on each message
arrow:
</p>


<p align="center">
  <img src="./client-server-msgs.png" alt="Client server msgs" style="width: 60%;">
</p>



<h4>Message Format</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
The declaration of [StateMoveMessage] is:
<pre>
type StateMoveMessage struct{
	GameState []uint8
	MoveRow int8
	MoveCount int8
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  In each message:
<ul>
<li>[GameState] represents the state of the game board as a slice of
unsigned bytes. This state is the state of the board <u>after the move
has been made (this move is also specified in the message)</u>. Each
element of this slice represents one row of coins. For example, below
a GameState of [6,6,4] represents a game board with three rows. The
first two rows contain 6 coins and the third row contains 4 coins.
</li>

<li> [MoveRow] either represents the row from which coins are to be
removed in a normal move, or indicates an opening message (-1).</li>
  
<li>[MoveCount] either represents the number of coins to be removed in
a normal move, or indicates a provided random seed.</li>
</ul>
</p>


Well-formed instances of a StateMoveMessage have three forms. These
are defined below, as are their semantics for being considered <b>legal
on receive</b>:
<ul>

  <li><tt>{nil, -1, [seed]}</tt></li>
  <ul><li>The opening message the client sends to the
  server to start a new game. [seed] is the random seed the server
  uses to generate the initial board. This is always considered legal
  on receive. If a game was already in progress, that game is
  considered abandoned.</li></ul>

  <li><tt>{GameState, -1, [seed]}</tt></li>
    <ul><li>The opening message the server sends
to the client, on creating a new game board. This is considered legal
on receive with respect to an opening message from the client with the
same seed.</li></ul>

  <li><tt>{GameState, MoveRow >= 0, MoveCount > 0}</tt></li>

  <ul><li>A move in the game with some valid number of coins to remove, and
  the row these are being removed from. This is considered legal on
  receive with respect to a StateMoveMessage{GameState', _, _} if
  [GameState] is the state reached after removing [MoveCount] coins
  from row [MoveRow] in [GameState'].</li></ul>
  
</ul>


<h4>Message Loss</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Packets sent via UDP are not guaranteed to arrive at their
destination. This means there will be no reply received if either the
client message or the server message is dropped by the network. <b>It
is the client's responsibility to re-attempt a message exchange, after
a timeout of 1s (after not receiving a response from the server 1s
after sending a message to the server).</b> You can assume that the
server will hang onto the last known state indefinitely, until the
client is able to make progress (get a message through to the server).
</p>

<p>
Note that when using UDP, a message may also arrive out of order,
and/or be duplicated by the network. Your solution must be able to
deal with both of these cases.
</p>

<p> If the server makes the last move, the client can terminate on
receiving this move. If the client makes the last move, the client can
terminate as soon as it transmits the move message, regardless of
delivery at the server.
</p>


<h4>Tracing Library</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>This assignment introduces the tracing library, which will be used
to test whether your code is behaving correctly. The library
has <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DistributedClocks/tracing">online
documentation</a> that you should familiarize yourself with.</p>

<p>Tracing is like logging. We say that a process records/reports/traces
actions or events. What this means is that the process calls a tracing
library method to record a particular struct type. A key difference
with logging is that tracing can be used to reconcile ordering of
events across networked nodes. To trace your program, the program
needs to connect to a tracing server. In this assignment your client
will have its own tracing server â€“ your client code will need to start
this tracing server, connect to it, run the client logic while
recording actions at specific points in the execution, and later
terminate the tracing server before exiting. A client-server example
that illustrates how to use the tracing library can be found
<a href="https://github.com/DistributedClocks/tracing/blob/0c7ae37adaaa/example/client-server/main.go">here</a>. (Note,
however, that in this example, the client and server use the same
tracing server and also use tracing tokens. In this assignment your
client will have its own tracing server and you will not need to deal
with tracing tokens.)
</p>



<h4>Tracing Semantics</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>Your solution must precisely follow the tracing semantics described
below. Your grade depends on the type of tracing log that your
solution generates. For example, if traced actions are in the wrong
order, or are missing, then you will lose points.</p>

<p>You will use the tracing library to report actions using calls to
<b>trace.RecordAction</b>, using a singular <b>trace</b> object obtained via
<b>tracer.CreateTrace</b>. You only need to implement tracing for actions
within your own client. There are four types of actions that your
  client code must trace:

<ul>  
<li>[GameStart{Seed}] marks the start of a new game. </li>

<ul>
  <li>This action should appear exactly once, before any other actions are recorded.</li>
  <li>Seed must be the randomization seed provided on the command line.</li></ul>

<li>[ClientMove{GameState, MoveRow, MoveCount}] indicates that a client has made a move.</li>

<ul>
<li>This action must be recorded <b>just before</b> sending the corresponding client move to the server, including the opening "move".</li>
<li>The exception below aside, this action must happen after a [ServerMoveReceive]. The [ClientMove] action must be legal on receive relative to its unique preceding [ServerMoveReceive], considering the first of any duplicates, if the same [ServerMoveReceive] is logged more than once.</li>
<li>The above condition does not apply to an initial [ClientMove], which must match the pattern [ClientMove{nil, -1, _}] for this exception to apply.
<br/>(One way of interpreting the above two bullets is that they pin client progress to server progress.)
</li></ul>

<li>[ServerMoveReceive{GameState, MoveRow, MoveCount}] indicates that a server's move has been received.</li>

<ul>
  <li>This action must be recorded <b>just after</b> receiving a move from the server, including the opening "move".</li>
  <li>If this action is recorded, there must exist at least one [ClientMove] that happens-before it.</li></ul>

<li>[GameComplete{Winner}] marks the end of a game.</li>

<ul>
  <li>This action must be recorded exactly once, after either a legal [ServerMoveReceive] or [ClientMove] (depending on the winner) with all entries in its [GameState] equal to 0.</li>

<li>This action must always be the last recorded action in a trace.</li></ul>
</ul>
  
</p>



<h4>Example Execution</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Below is an example sequence of messages from a correct execution of
this system with one client and one server (these messages also
illustrated in a diagram below):
<pre>
From client: StateMoveMessage {
       	GameState: nil
	MoveRow: -1
	MoveCount: 32
}
From server: StateMoveMessage {
	GameState: [6,6,4]
	MoveRow: -1
	MoveCount: 32
}
From client: StateMoveMessage {
        GameState: [6,1,4]
        MoveRow: 1
        MoveCount: 5 
}
From server: StateMoveMessage {
        GameState: [6,6,4]
	MoveRow: -1
	MoveCount: 32
} (duplicated)
From server: StateMoveMessage {
	GameState: [0,1,4]
	MoveRow: 0
	MoveCount: 6
}
From client: StateMoveMessage {
	GameState: [0,1,1]
	MoveRow: 2
	MoveCount: 3
} (lost)
From client: StateMoveMessage {
	GameState: [0,1,1]
	MoveRow: 2
	MoveCount: 3
}
From server: StateMoveMessage {
	GameState: [0,0,1]
	MoveRow: 1
	MoveCount: 1
}
From client: StateMoveMessage {
	GameState: [0,0,0]
	MoveRow: 2
	MoveCount: 1
} (lost)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The diagram below illustrates the above execution as a time space
diagram. In addition, this diagram lists the traced actions as boxes
on the client timeline. Note that the traced actions are located at
very precise points in the client timeline relative to when the client
received or sent each message.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./client-server-tracing.png" alt="Client server tracing example" style="width: 70%;">
</p>

<p>
An important feature of the above execution (and tracing semantics in
this assignment) is that actions are recorded in response to all
received/generated messages (i.e., even those that are received as
duplicated by the client or those that are re-sent by the client
because of message loss).
</p>

<h4>Solution Spec</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p> 
You are to write a single go program called <b>client.go</b> that acts as a client in the protocol described above. Your program must be executable from the terminal using the following command:<br/>
<i><b>$ go run client.go [seed]</b></i><br/>
Where [seed] is the random seed to be sent to the server in the client's first move to generate a game board.</p>

<p>
The ports to be used by the client to connect to the server at and to listen on are provided/configured in [config/client_config.json].
<ul>
<li>[ClientAddress]: local address that the client uses to connect to both the server and the fserver (i.e., the external IP of the machine the client is running on)</li>
<li>[NimServerAddress]: the UDP address on which the server receives new client connections</li>
<li>[TracingServerAddress]: the UDP address at which you are to run the tracing server</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Your solution cannot use any external libraries other than those
related to the tracing library.</p>


<h4>Assumptions you can make</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>All messages fit into 1024 bytes</li>
    <li>The board for a game does not exceed 16 rows</li>
    <li>The number of coins in each row does not exceed 10</li>
    <li>The server does not fail and responds in a timely manner</li>
    <li>The server follows correct game logic (does not logically misbehave)</li>
    <li>Messages will not be corrupted</li>
    <li>The opening messages sent from clients can't be duplicated or severely delayed</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Assumptions you cannot make</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>UDP is reliable</li>
  </ul>

</p>


<h4>Protocol corner cases</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>
<p>

  <ul>

    <li>During a game, the server expects each incoming move to be valid for the directly preceding game state. If it is not, the server resends the previous move it made.</li>

    <li>Your code should use a 1 second timeout for message loss (before attempting to retransmit a message)</li>

  </ul>

</p>



<h4>Implementation requirements</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>
<p>
  <ul>

    <li>The client code must be runnable on CS ugrad machines and be
    compatible with Go version <b>1.16.7</b> (which is installed on
    ugrad machines)</li>
    
    <li>You must use UDP and the message types given out in the initial code</li>

    <li><font color="FF0000">Messages must be encoded using <tt>encoding/gob</tt>.</font></li>
    
    <li>Your solution can only use standard library Go packages</li>
    
    <li>Your solution code must be Gofmt'd using gofmt</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h4>Starter code and testing servers</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
  We make four files available for you as starter code for this assignment, as well as <a href="https://github.com/bestchai/cs416_2021w2/tree/main/assign1/spec">an automated checking tool</a> to analyze your distributed traces.

  <ol>
    <li><a href="client.go">client.go</a> : starter code for your
      client.go. This file assumes a tracing configuration file that
      is available in <tt>./config/client_config.json</tt>.</li>
    
    <li><a href="config/client_config.json">client_config.json</a> :
      config file that you can use for this assignment. (Note that you
      may need to change port numbers in case other students are
      running the tracing server/client on the same ugrad
      server.)</li>

    <li><a href="./go.mod">go.mod</a> : contains dependency tracking metadata, including a
      dependency on https://github.com/DistributedClocks/tracing, the
      tracing library.</li>

    <li><a href="./go.sum">go.sum</a> : contains auto-generated metadata (checksums for
      module dependencies). You should not need to touch or understand
      this file.</li>

  </ol>
</p>

<p>The list of nim servers you can test against will be posted to
piazza.</p>

<p>
  The provided checking tool's output will be strongly correlated with what our autograder will consider correct (though our test scenarios themselves remain secret), so make sure to try it.
  It is much easier to investigate and ask questions before the deadline than to be surprised after.
</p>


<h4>Handin instructions</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Keep the provided file layout at the top-level in your solution
repository. You may include additional files, but we do not expect
this will be necessary. Do not reference any additional libraries in
your solution.
</p>

<p>
<font color="FF0000">
  <b>
    Your code must be in a single <tt>client.go</tt> file, including the tracing server set up.
    You shall not use a separate file to run the tracing server.
    (This requirement only affects your Go files, you should still have a config file
    for your tracing server, and place it at <tt>config/tracing_server_config.json</tt>).
    <br/> <br/>

    Your code must not change the UDP message
    format and tracing spec. Your code must work on ugrad servers (e.g.,
    remote.students.cs.ubc.ca). <br/> <br/>


    If any of these are violated, your mark for this assignment is 0. This is true regardless of how
    many characters had to be changed to make your solution compile, and
    regardless of how well your solution works with a different API or on
    a different machine.

<h4>Advice</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>
<p>
<ul>

  <li>
    Start simple, and do not worry about UDP edge cases until the
    happy path works.
  </li>

  <li>Be extra careful with where and when you trace actions. These
    must be correct for you to receive the above marks.</li>

  <li>Do not attempt to win the game as a starting point. Leave the
    bonus to the end.</li>

  <li>Compile and run your code on the ugrad servers.</li>

</ul>
